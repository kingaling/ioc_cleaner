This script takes a directory of IOC's and compares all of the IP's/hostnames within, to a list of curently targeted IP's/hostnames.<br />

Why have IOC's that felt you didn't need to block in your infrastructure?
Too often, outside intel is vague AND vast. There is such a thing as a bad indicator.</p>
